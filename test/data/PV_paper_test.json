The inputs and outputs were obtained using site investigation, questionnaires, and field monitoring, and a method of aggregating the data into an industry-level database was established. The production yield of the studied samples accounted for an average  $66\\%$  of the national yield in 2013. The results showed that the respiratory-inorganics and fossil-fuel categories contributed the most impact, because of the large electricity consumption required. Recent technological advances in raw material reduction and energy savings are the primary pathways to decreasing the environmental impacts. The environmental impact of a photovoltaic system is equivalent to  $4.5\\%$  of that of the impact of the current coal-based electrical power system in China. The pollutant payback times of chemical oxygen demand, chloride, fluoride, ammonia gas, nitric oxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride and carbon dioxide are 5.11, 1.02, 25.1, 8.01, 0.831, 0.784, 0.716, 1.12 and 0.884 years, respectively, indicating that most of the pollutants could be paid back within the expected lifetime of a photovoltaic system. Therefore, installing photovoltaic systems could reduce not only the consumption of non-renewable energy, but also the emitted pollutants, decreasing the environmental impacts of electricity generation.","page_number":1},{"text":"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

An earlier LCA of photovoltaic use focused on its increase since the 1970s and on the consequent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (Hunt, 1976). In recent years, an increasing number of studies on the life cycle energy and environmental analysis of photovoltaic systems, especially analyses relating to energy payback time and greenhouse gases, have been conducted. Peng et al. (2013) reviewed an LCA of energy payback time and greenhouse gas emissions for solar photovoltaic systems, and reported that the cumulative payback energy requirements for multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) systems in the reviewed literature (Alsema, 2000; Ito et al., 2003; Fthenakis and Alsema,","page_number":1},{"text":"2006; Pacca et al., 2007; Lu and Yang, 2010; Zhai and Williams, 2010) were estimated to be  $2699 - 5150\\mathrm{MJ} / \\mathrm{m}^2$ . The energy payback time (EPBT) and greenhouse gas emission rate were 1.7-3.3 years and  $12 - 72\\mathrm{gCO_2}$  eq/kWh, respectively. In 2016, Leccisi et al. reported energy payback times ranging from 0.9 years for multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaic production at high irradiation  $(2300\\mathrm{kWh}\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{y}^{-1})$  to 2.8 years for single-crystalline silicon photovoltaic production at low irradiation  $(1000\\mathrm{kWh}\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{y}^{-1})$  (Leccisi et al., 2016). The main LCA studies of photovoltaic systems in the last five years have shown varying results, such as wide ranges of GHG emissions (from 15.8 to  $88.74\\mathrm{gCO_2}$  eq/kWh) and of energy payback times (0.68-16.9 years). Different studies have used different methods, with different boundary conditions and analytical periods (from 2006 to 2016); relied on different data sources and impact assessment methods (Eco-Indicator 99, IMPACT  $2002+$ , EPS2000, CML2001); considered different solar irradiation values (ranging from 1100 to  $2453\\mathrm{kWh}\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{y}^{-1}$ ) and different power constructions in different locations (European, Spanish, Germany, China, the United States); and modelled different photovoltaic technologies, installation types, module efficiencies, lifetimes, and PV system performance ratios and capacities (Diao and Shi, 2011; Fthenakis and Kim, 2011, 2013; Sumper et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2011; Desideri et al., 2012; de Wild-Scholten, 2013; Stylos and Koroneos, 2014; Fu et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015; Lamnatou and Chemisana, 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Hong et al., 2016).

This process begins with \"Hydrogen production\" and \"Liquid chlorine\" forming \"Hydrogen chloride\". \"Hydrogen chloride\" then reacts with \"Trichlorosilane\", which undergoes \"Purification\". Separately, \"Preparation of silicon core\" leads to \"Reduction\". \"Purification\" supplies \"Chlorosilane\" to \"Reduction\", which, along with recycled \"Chlorosilane\" from \"Off-gas recovery and recycling\", produces \"Solar-grade Silicon\". \"Transportation\" is an input to \"Trichlorosilane\". \"Off-gas recovery and recycling\" processes \"HCl\" and \"H2\" from various stages.\n\n**The top-right block** details the production of \"Silicon Wafer\". This sequence starts with a \"Crucible\", followed by \"Ingot grinding\", which forms \"Square ingots\" that are \"Cut into bricks\". These are then \"Clean\"ed. \"Splice glass\", utilizing \"Glass\", precedes the \"Slice into wafer\" step, which also uses \"Steel wire\" and \"SiC+PEG\". After slicing, \"Debond glass\" occurs, followed by another \"Clean\" step, leading to the final \"Silicon Wafer\".\n\n**The bottom-left block** shows the production of a \"Silicon solar cell\" from \"Solar-grade Silicon\" (indicated by a dashed line connection). This process involves \"Surface texture & Cleaning\" (using \"KOH, HNO3, HF, HCl\"), followed by \"Phosphorus diffusing & etching\" (using \"POCl3, KOH, HF, HNO3\"). Next is \"PECVD\" (Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition), which uses \"Silane\" and \"Liquid ammonia\". The final step in this block is \"Screen print\", which applies \"Metallization paste, Ag\" and \"Metallization paste, Al\", resulting in a \"Silicon solar cell\".\n\n**The bottom-right block** outlines the production of a \"PV panel\" from a \"Silicon solar cell\" (indicated by a dashed line connection). This block includes \"Concatenation\", \"Welding\", \"Lamination\" (using \"Solder\" and \"EVA, glass, back foil\"), and \"Trimming\".
