Methanol, known as \"clean coal,\" \"cheap oil,\" \"mobile electricity,\" and \"liquid hydrogen,\" finds extensive application across industries, from chemicals to energy[1]. G.A. Olah's[2] proposition of the \"Methanol economy\" anticipates its heightened prominence in the coming years, potentially ushering in a new fuel era. Currently, global methanol demand has doubled in the past decade, reaching 107 million tons[3]. With a 99.47 million-ton production capacity in 2022—an  $8.84\\%$  increase from the previous year—China leads the world methanol industry in terms of new production capacity. In the same year, China's methanol production reached 8.306 million tons, marking a  $6.27\\%$  year-on-year rise[4]. Methanol demand is still rising, propelled by consistent",

Data indicates a notable surge in methanol consumption in China, reaching 7.808 million tons in apparent consumption in 2021, a  $5.96\\%$  increase from the previous year [6]. This trend intensified in 2022, with apparent methanol consumption hitting 90 million tons, reflecting a  $15.26\\%$  year-on-year rise[7]. Methanol, a vital chemical raw material, primarily serves downstream industries like olefins and acetic acid[3]. In 2021, methanol to olefins accounted for  $50.59\\%$  of demand, followed by methanol fuel at  $15.66\\%$  [8]. Diverse technologies presently produce methanol from fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal, crude oil, and biomass[9]. In China, the resource distribution - \"more coal, less oil, and less gas\"[4,10] has historically favored the coal-to-olefins route (58% in 2017), with coal-to-gas (17%) and natural gas-to-methanol (14%) following suit[11].

However, there are very few thorough research on the most modern carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol technologies as well as older traditional energy-to-methanol methods. Notably, the Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) route's economic and environmental features have attracted a lot of interest[17]. González-Garay et al.[18] conducted an exhaustive evaluation of methanol production from carbon dioxide and renewable hydrogen process simulation and lifecycle analysis reveal that green methanol's current cost is 1.3 to 2.6 times higher than conventional fossil-based alternatives, mainly due to hydrogen pricing. Similarly, Pérez-Fortes et al.[19] assessed methanol production using hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide, indicating limited carbon emission reduction potential compared to traditional European methods. Cuellar-Franca et al.[20] reviewed 27 life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies, highlighting CCU's heavy reliance on renewable energy and its associated environmental imbalances. They recommend that entire lifecycle analysis, electrolysis of renewable electricity for hydrogen synthesis, and carbon dioxide purification procedures be included in LCA study for pertinent insights. Thonemann[21] conducted an analysis of LCA-based  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  chemical production, finding no  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -based technology superior in all impact categories to conventional methods. Methanol production pathways, including biomass gasification and  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  recovery from fossil fuel-fired power station flue gases, have been explored by Shamsul et al.[22], addressing bio-methanol's potential as a renewable resource, considering global demand, economic assessment, power density, and potential applications[23]. Zhen et al.[24] describe various methanol production approaches, encompassing coal, natural gas, coke-oven gas, hydrogen, and biomass. Dalena et al.[25] review prevalent feedstocks (natural gas,  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , coke/biomass) and methanol production processes, including membrane reactor technology's catalytic conversion of methanol to high-grade hydrogen. Additionally, Blumberg et. Al[26] address methanol synthesis economics with different reforming technologies, evaluating process efficiency for steam reforming, autothermal reforming, and dry methane reforming, along with economic and sensitivity analyses. Gautam et al. present a comprehensive overview of thermo-chemical and biochemical routes for sustainable bio-methanol production from waste biomass. Chen Z et al.[11] conducted a \"cradle to gate\" life-cycle assessment of COTM (Coal Coking to Methanol), CGTM(Coal Gasification to Methanol), and NGTM(Natural Gas to Methanol), offering a comparison of three traditional technology roadmaps.

In Fig. 2, the individual production paths are shown. The analysis uses a \"cradle to gate\" boundary and concentrates on the extraction of raw materials through the manufacturing of methanol, leaving out effects connected to facilities and infrastructure. Solid garbage is delivered to a nearby landfill while wastewater is processed and repurposed. In the fuel gas system, exhaust gases are either flared or recycled. Waste catalyst is not taken into account when calculating solid waste because the catalyst used in the process has a 3-5 year replacement cycle and stays constant during the production of methanol. Notably, because the post-production processes are the same for all routes, methanol application is not addressed.

After that, the gas from the coke furnace is compressed to provide the perfect conditions for methanol synthesis. The syngas from the reformer is subjected to elevated pressure before being transferred to the methanol synthesis reactor.

NGTM use renewable biomass as a fuel in a sequence of chemical reactions to produce methanol. NGTM has a lower impact on land resources than the usage of fossil fuels. Crop residues, wood wastes, and industrial organic wastes, among other things, are recycled during the biomass production process. This decreases trash pollution on the ground and enhances land resource usage.
